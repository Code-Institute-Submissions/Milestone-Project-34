This project is designed as a three page  project that will demonstrate my ability with using HTML and CSS for my **Milestone One project for Code Institute**. The project uses core front end technologies along with the Bootstrap front-end framework for added responsivness and for improved cross browser compatability. The site also takes advantage of Google Fonts to allow for more of a modern feeling typgrophy set.
